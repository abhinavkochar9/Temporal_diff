Title: Shoulder Rolls
Shoulder rolls help regain shoulder mobility and strength after breast cancer surgery. They support lymphatic flow and proper breathing.

Instructions:
1. Sit or stand comfortably.
2. Gently squeeze both shoulder blades back and down in a circular motion.
3. Repeat 4 times.
Tip: Inhale deeply when pulling your shoulders back to expand your ribs and improve oxygen flow.
