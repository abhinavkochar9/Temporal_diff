Title: Deep Breathing
Muscle tightening deep breathing stimulates lymphatic ducts and helps lymph fluid drain. It promotes whole-body muscle pumping, which supports lymphatic drainage. It also improves oxygen flow and healing.

Instructions:
1. Sit or stand comfortably.
2. Place your hands on your abdomen.
3. Inhale slowly through your nose while tightening your whole body muscles. Visualize fluid moving to your chest.
4. Exhale slowly through your mouth while relaxing your muscles. Visualize pushing fluid out.
Repeat 4 times.
