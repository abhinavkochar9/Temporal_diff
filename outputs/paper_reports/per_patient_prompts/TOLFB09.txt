Instructions for LLM (use metrics above; do NOT invent baselines):
- Write a concise clinical-style summary of deviations across angles, positions, and timing.
- Mention worst and best exercises and quantify the errors.
- Suggest 2–3 corrective cues (e.g., raise right elbow ~10°, keep wrist level with shoulder).
