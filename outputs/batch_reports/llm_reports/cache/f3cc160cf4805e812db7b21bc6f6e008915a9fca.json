  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent execution of the Deep Breathing exercise.  While the initial repetitions showed minimal movement, subsequent repetitions revealed significant excessive movement in the elbows and wrists, particularly on the right side. This suggests a need to focus on controlled whole-body muscle engagement during inhalation and relaxation during exhalation, as instructed.  Improved visualization of fluid movement may also enhance performance.",
