Concentrate on the instruction to gently squeeze your shoulder blades back and down in a circular motion.  Avoid using other parts of your arms to assist the movement."

  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated some understanding of the Shoulder Roll exercise, attempting to move the shoulder blades. However, consistent high MAE values in the wrists and elbows across all steps indicate a need for improved form.  The patient needs to focus on isolating the shoulder blade movement and avoiding unnecessary arm and wrist involvement.  Deep inhalation during the back movement should also be emphasized.",
