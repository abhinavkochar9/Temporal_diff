Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body and avoid unnecessary wrist movement. Remember to squeeze your shoulder blades together and down, initiating the movement from your back muscles."

      "feedback": "The MAE values show some improvement in wrist and elbow control compared to step 1, but there's still room for improvement.  The instruction to 'squeeze both shoulder blades back and down' needs more attention.  Ensure the movement originates from the shoulder blades, not just the arms.  Try to maintain a smoother, more controlled circular motion."

      "feedback": "The MAE values for the wrists remain high, indicating that the focus on shoulder blade movement needs further refinement.  The instruction to inhale deeply when pulling your shoulders back was likely not fully implemented, as the movement does not seem fully controlled.  Concentrate on coordinating your breath with the movement, inhaling as you pull your shoulders back and exhaling as you return to the starting position."

  "exercise_summary": "The patient attempted the Shoulder Rolls exercise, but the execution needs significant improvement.  The primary issue is a lack of control and isolation of the shoulder movement, with excessive involvement of the elbows and wrists.  The patient needs to focus on initiating the movement from the shoulder blades, maintaining a controlled circular motion, and coordinating their breath with the movement as instructed.  Improved body awareness and concentration on the specific muscle groups involved will enhance the exercise's effectiveness.",
