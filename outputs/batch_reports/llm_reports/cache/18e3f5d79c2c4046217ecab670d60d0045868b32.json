High MAE values in the right elbow and wrist across all steps indicate incomplete extension overhead.  Focus on fully extending the arm overhead, opening the hand completely, and maintaining this posture throughout each step.  Improved consistency in the right arm is needed to optimize the effectiveness of the exercise.",
