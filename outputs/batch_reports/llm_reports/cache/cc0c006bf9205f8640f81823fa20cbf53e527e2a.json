      "feedback": "While the shoulder movements in repetitions 1 and 2 show good form, the elbow and wrist movements need significant improvement.  The instructions specify bringing arms in front of the chest with closed fists (inhaling and tightening muscles), then extending horizontally to shoulder height with open fingers (exhaling and relaxing muscles). The high MAE values for elbows and wrists in repetition 2 suggest that the full range of motion was not achieved and the muscle tightening/relaxing was inconsistent."

  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Horizontal Pumping exercise.  While shoulder movements showed some improvement, the elbow and wrist movements consistently fell short of the full range of motion specified in the instructions.  The patient needs to focus on fully extending their arms horizontally to shoulder height while coordinating their breathing and muscle tension/relaxation.  More attention should be paid to the smooth transition between the arm positions and the complete relaxation during the exhale phase.",
