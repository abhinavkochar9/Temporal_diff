Inhaling technique showed improvement, but coordinating whole-body muscle tightening with the breath needs more focus.  The exhale needs more attention to ensure slow, controlled release and visualization of fluid movement.  Overall, the exercise requires more practice to fully coordinate all aspects of the instructions.",
