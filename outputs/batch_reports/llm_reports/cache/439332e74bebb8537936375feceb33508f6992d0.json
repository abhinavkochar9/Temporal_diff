While some repetitions showed acceptable form, many exhibited high MAE values in the wrists and elbows, indicating a lack of control and precision in the arm movements.  The patient needs to focus on maintaining consistent muscle engagement, a slow and controlled range of motion, and smooth transitions between the arm's inward and outward positions.",
