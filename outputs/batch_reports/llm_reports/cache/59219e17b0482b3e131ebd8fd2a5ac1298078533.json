  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated a good understanding of the Shoulder Roll exercise. Step 1 was performed well, showing a smooth circular motion. However, steps 2 and 3 showed inconsistencies in the movement, suggesting a need to focus on maintaining a controlled and consistent circular motion of the shoulder blades throughout the exercise.  Deep inhalation during the backward movement should be emphasized to improve rib expansion and oxygen flow.",
