  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Horizontal Pumping exercise.  While some repetitions showed good form in certain areas, overall control and consistency were lacking, particularly in the elbows and wrists.  The patient needs to focus on maintaining a tighter fist during the inhale phase, smoother transitions between arm positions, and more controlled movements throughout the entire range of motion.  Improved muscle engagement and controlled breathing will enhance the effectiveness of the exercise.",
