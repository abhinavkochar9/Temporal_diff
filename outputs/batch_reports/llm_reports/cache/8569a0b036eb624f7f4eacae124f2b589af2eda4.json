While the initial step showed good form, steps 2 and 3 revealed inconsistencies in maintaining a smooth, controlled circular motion throughout the four repetitions.  Focusing on deep inhalation during the backward shoulder movement and maintaining a consistent circular motion will improve the exercise's effectiveness.",
