  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent execution of the Overhead Pumping exercise.  While the arm was generally positioned overhead, the range of motion in the wrist and elbow was inconsistent, and the fist clenching and hand opening were not fully executed in many repetitions.  Focus is needed on maintaining a straight arm, fully opening the hand, making a tight fist, and coordinating the movements with breathing.  Improved consistency in the range of motion is crucial for effective lymph drainage.",
