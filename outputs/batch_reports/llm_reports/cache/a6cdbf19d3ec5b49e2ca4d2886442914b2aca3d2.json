  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Overhead Pumping exercise.  While attempts were made to follow the instructions, significant deviations were observed in maintaining a fully extended arm and fully opening/closing the hand.  Improved focus on fully extending the arm, completely opening the hand, and fully clenching the fist is needed for optimal results.  Visualizing fluid movement during the exercise may aid in improving form and consistency.",
