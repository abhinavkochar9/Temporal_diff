  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Overhead Pumping exercise.  While the shoulder movement was generally acceptable, the elbow and wrist movements showed significant deviations from the ideal straight arm position.  The patient needs to focus on maintaining a straight arm overhead and avoid bending at the elbows and wrists.  Consistent and controlled movements are crucial for effective lymph drainage.  Improved focus and visualization of fluid movement may also help.",
