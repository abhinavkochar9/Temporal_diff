  "exercise_summary": "The Horizontal Pumping exercise demonstrated inconsistent form throughout all steps.  While the patient attempted the movements, significant deviations were observed in wrist and elbow positioning across multiple repetitions.  Improved focus on maintaining a controlled, horizontal arm extension at shoulder height, with straight wrists and aligned forearms, is needed.  Smooth transitions between the inhalation/fist clenching and exhalation/arm extension phases should also be emphasized.",
