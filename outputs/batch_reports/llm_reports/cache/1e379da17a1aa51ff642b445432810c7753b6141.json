  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated understanding of the Horizontal Pumping exercise.  While the initial arm-in phase was executed well, maintaining consistent and symmetrical movement throughout the arm extension and relaxation phases needs improvement.  The patient should focus on controlled, even movements in both arms, ensuring complete relaxation during the exhale and extension.  More attention to smooth transitions between phases is recommended.",
