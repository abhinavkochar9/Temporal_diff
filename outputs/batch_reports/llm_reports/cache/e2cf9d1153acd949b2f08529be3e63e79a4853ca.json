  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Horizontal Pumping exercise.  While some repetitions showed acceptable MAE values, many exhibited significant deviations, particularly in the wrists and elbows.  The patient needs to focus on controlled movements, smooth transitions between phases, and consistent muscle engagement and relaxation.  Improved coordination and attention to detail are crucial for proper execution.",
