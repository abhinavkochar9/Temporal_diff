While the final step demonstrated good control, the initial steps revealed significant deviations from the ideal straight arm position, particularly in the elbow and wrist.  Focus on maintaining a straight arm overhead and fully opening and closing the hand with each repetition.  Consistent practice will improve form and maximize the effectiveness of the exercise.",
