While some effort was shown in extending the arms overhead, maintaining a straight arm, fully opening the hand, and synchronizing hand movements with breathing needs significant improvement.  The left arm consistently showed less engagement than the right arm.  Greater focus on controlled movements and bilateral engagement is required.",
