  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Overhead Pumping exercise. While some reps showed acceptable movement, others exhibited significant deviations from the ideal posture, particularly in the elbow and wrist.  The patient needs to focus on maintaining a straight arm overhead, fully opening and closing their hand, and performing the exercise with a controlled, smooth movement.  Improved concentration on maintaining proper form and breathing will improve the effectiveness of the exercise.",
