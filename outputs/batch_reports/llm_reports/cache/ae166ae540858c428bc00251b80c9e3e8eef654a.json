  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent execution of the Deep Breathing exercise. While the core instructions of hand placement and controlled breathing were largely followed, significant unnecessary movement was observed in the right wrist across multiple repetitions, particularly during inhalation and exhalation.  This suggests a need for improved focus on whole-body muscle engagement and visualization techniques as described in the instructions.  Improved core stability and controlled breathing will enhance the effectiveness of the exercise.",
