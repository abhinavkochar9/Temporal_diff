  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Horizontal Pumping exercise. While some repetitions showed good control and proper muscle engagement, others exhibited significant increases in MAE values, particularly in the wrists and elbows, indicating a need for improved control and consistency in movement.  Focus on maintaining a smooth, controlled movement throughout the entire range of motion, ensuring that the fists are clenched tightly during the inward arm movement and that the arms extend fully to shoulder height during the outward movement.  Remember to coordinate breathing with the movements, inhaling during muscle tightening and exhaling during relaxation.",
