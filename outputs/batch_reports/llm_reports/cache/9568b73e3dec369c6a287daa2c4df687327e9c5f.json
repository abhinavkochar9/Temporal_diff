  "exercise_summary": "The Horizontal Pumping exercise demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the repetitions. While some repetitions showed good form, many lacked consistency in fist clenching, arm extension, and muscle engagement.  Focus on maintaining a controlled, horizontal movement of the arms, avoiding jerky motions and ensuring complete fist closure and full extension to shoulder height.  Consistent practice is key to improving form and maximizing the benefits of the exercise.",
