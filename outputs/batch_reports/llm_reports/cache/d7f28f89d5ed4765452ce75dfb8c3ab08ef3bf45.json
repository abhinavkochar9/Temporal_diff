Focus on fully closing your fists while inhaling and tightening muscles, then fully opening them during exhalation and muscle relaxation.  The right wrist shows particularly high MAE, suggesting a need for more controlled movement."

  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated inconsistent form throughout the Horizontal Pumping exercise.  While there was some attempt to follow instructions, significant improvements are needed in maintaining controlled movements, coordinating breathing with arm movements, and ensuring consistent fist closure and opening.  The high MAE values in several joints across multiple repetitions indicate a need for more precise and controlled execution.",
