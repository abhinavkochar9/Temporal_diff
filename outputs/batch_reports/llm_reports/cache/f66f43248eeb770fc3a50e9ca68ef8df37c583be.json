The instructions mention tightening your whole body muscles during inhalation; focus on this aspect to improve lymphatic stimulation. Visualizing the fluid movement will enhance the exercise's effectiveness."

Concentrate on a slow, controlled exhale through your mouth to maximize lymphatic drainage.  The variation in wrist movement between repetitions suggests inconsistent muscle relaxation."

  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated good posture and hand placement during the exercise.  However, there's room for improvement in fully engaging whole body muscles during inhalation and completely relaxing them during exhalation.  Focusing on the visualization techniques and ensuring consistent muscle engagement throughout will significantly enhance the exercise's benefits.",
