Try to isolate the shoulder movement more and maintain a smoother, controlled circle.  Deep inhalations during the backward movement will help."

  "exercise_summary": "The patient demonstrated understanding of the Shoulder Roll exercise. Step 1 was performed well, showing good control and form. However, steps 2 and 3 showed inconsistencies, with excessive movement in the elbows and wrists.  More focus on isolating the shoulder blade movement and maintaining a smooth circular motion is needed.  Incorporating deep breaths during the backward movement will improve the exercise's effectiveness.",
